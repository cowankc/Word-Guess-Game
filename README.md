NBA Word Guess!

This game is designed like a hangman style of game. The user must try and figure out 
what the word is before they run out of guesses. The words are made up of NBA players 
from different eras. See how many you can get before you get tripped up! Once you get 
the page loaded press any key to start guessing the letter of the player named chose at 
random by the computer. This is one of my first javascript projects so hopefully it all 
runs well. Good Luck!
